## Team Objective

#### Move along PSNR - Per curve

#### 1. Undergrad's tips and tricks: 
  - 1. [ ] Mean shift per patch 
  - 2. [ ] RGB shuffle 
  
#### 2. DownMSE loss 

#### 3. Architecture adjustment 

#### 4. Laplace form

#### 5. Handle faces directly 


## Overall Progress 

#### 08/15 Wednesday: 
  ##### A. RGBshuffle 
  - 1. [x] Fix directory saving for model testing 
  - 2. [x] Implement rgb random shuffle, random in channels
  - 3. [x] Test & confirm the shuffling 
  - * [ ] save the shuffle img patches for sanity check 
  
  ##### B. DownMSE loss 
  - 1. [ ] save the LR images from SR 
  - 2. [ ] Implement downMSE
  
  ##### C. others: 
  - 1. [ ] Display previous running results F_per vs. PSNR score 
  - 2. [ ] Reply Cynthia 
  - 3. [ ] Draft office desk email 
  
  ##### Readings & theoretical analysis
  - 1. [ ] Read about PSNR theory 
  - 2. [ ] Analysis GAN loss in different scalers
